Absymal,The toilet and sinks backed up every day except day 1 with black water that smelled like raw sewage. It made for a very unromantic stay and we had to use bathrooms in the lobby and casino. It was not satisfactory at all.,drpgclark,July 2019,1.0
Poor in-room air quality and subpar cleanliness,Poor in-room air quality caused sore throat and sinus issues. Overall room was outdated and subpar cleanliness.

Dated Hotel,MGM Grand is in bad need of an update. The rooms are dated and could use some TLC. The location is far end of strip so not as ideal as other places. They do have some great food options on site and their pool is nice. Price was too good to pass with the fact the convention was…,Adam M,May 2018,3.0
Not up to its normal standards,"I checked in late , as our flight arrived at 1030pm. Upon checkin, the desk clerk told me I had to leave a 400 dollar deposit, on top of the resort fee and deposit I had already made.

No extras,"Rooms were nice and clean,They nickel and dime everything, We had to pay $16.00 a day to park. No perks at all even hotel chains give you a small coffee pot and coffee.Very disappointing if you expect to be looked like a guest you get treated more like a $$$",Bobbihat,May 2018,3.0

Great atmosphere.,We enjoy the mgm. Not overly Smokey like ballys. The casino is big with all the latest games. Rooms are very clean and updated. Our house keeper was great. It's at the end of the strip but monorail is clean and fast.,mandy384,May 2018,5.0
Lots to do.,"Lots of food choices for all budgets, KA is the best of the Cirque du Soleil shows, Morrimottos Tapanyaki is amazing, there is lots to do besides gambling as well. The lazy river pool was great, but i would recommend getting here early, it gets too congested by 3:00 p.m.",Lynwin63,May 2018,4.0
Iconic Center of the Vegas Experience,I spent four days in Vegas for my friend's bachelor party (probably a common reason for coming) and chose the MGM Grand due to proximity to the rest of the crew.

"Decadent, impersonal","I was suppose to spend 3 nights attending a conference at the MGM convention center. From the moment you arrive to the lobby there is no one to help you or indicate you what to do. After doing a huge line, you get your keys and walk by yourself among the crowds of people that…",Monica F,May 2018,1.0

Horrible room. Very disappointed.,"We got to our room and all seemed ok. We originally booked a West wing king.
